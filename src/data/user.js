			"My name is Shabnam Ara, and I am from Ghaziabad. I received my early education at Government Girls Senior Secondary School in Vivek Vihar, Delhi. My academic journey continued as I pursued a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) degree from CCSU (Chaudhary Charan Singh University) and later achieved a Master's degree in Computer Applications (MCA) from AKTU (Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University). In terms of technical skills, I possess proficiency in a range of web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS. I've had the opportunity to apply these skills in various projects, such as creating login and registration pages, developing a GYM website, crafting an Amazon clone, and designing user-friendly signup pages.",
